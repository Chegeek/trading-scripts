Various scripts for trading cryptocurrency

adjust_alerts_public.php is for when you have a bunch of alerts in coinigy but you want to go to sleep. The script goes through each of your alerts and adjusts them down some percentage you specify in the file. When you wake up the next day, you can run the script again with a higher percentage to raise the ones that didn't go off back up.
