githubs with a bunch of files and no explanation suck so here goes:

Download the files, remove the capitalized suffix and put your api keys in api_keys.py, make sure you have requests installed and you are using Python3. Run base_scanner.py and it will put base alerts in your Coinigy. To remove the alerts, run manage_alerts.py
