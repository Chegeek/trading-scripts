Download the files, remove the capitalized suffix and put your Coinigy api keys in api_keys.py, make sure you have requests installed and you are using Python3. Run base_scanner.py and it will put base alerts in your Coinigy. To remove the alerts, run manage_alerts.py

If you're on a Mac, make sure you have certificates installed. It's a non-default option in the Python3 installer. If you forget just Google it after you see the SSL error.
